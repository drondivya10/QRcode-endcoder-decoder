QR Code using Python

QR codes have a variety of uses; from creating a payment gateway to showing you the food menu of a restaurant, a QR code is being used in several ways. Over the past five years, several businesses have started that are only based on creating QR codes for a business. So if you know how to create a QR code, it will be helpful for you in many ways.

So to create QR codes using the Python programming language, you first need to make sure that you have the PyQRCode and pypng modules installed in your Python virtual environment. You can easily install both of these modules by executing the commands mentioned below in your command prompt or terminal:

pip install PyQRCode
pip install pypng

Part 2

Decode a QR Code using Python

I recently shared an article on creating a QR code using Python. If you want to learn about creating a QR code, you can learn more about it from here. To decode a QR code, you need an image of a QR code. You can use any QR code image for this tutorial, or you can create your QR code.

For decoding QR codes using Python, you need to install two Python libraries in your Python environment; pyzbar and pillow. You can install both these libraries by executing the commands mentioned below in your command prompt or terminal:

pip install pyzbar
pip install pillow
